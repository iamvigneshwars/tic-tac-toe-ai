##  How does it work? 

The AI uses a minimax algorithm to search all the possible game states and chooses the optimal move assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. The minimax function is recursive in which the maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to get the lowest score possible. The scores are calculated at the terminal game states (win, lose or tie).
